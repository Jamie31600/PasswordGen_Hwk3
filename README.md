# PasswordGen_Hwk3
This latest homework project was to make a password generator based on user prompts which was limited to a character set amount of between 8 and 128. The prompts will ask how many characters, upper and/or lower case letters, numbers, and if they would like to include any special characters in their new password. A random password will then be genrerated once they click the generated password button as specified in an alert.
